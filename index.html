                <h1>Hey, I'm Eddy Gomez</h1>
                <p>I am an accomplished front-end developer from Jacksonville, FL. I've worked at Newfold Digital for
                    <span></span> years, with over <span></span> years in a front-end developer role. I am passionate
                    about finding creative solutions to complex problems while learning a thing or two along the way.

                <p>I've been working on different aspects of websites all through my tenure at Newfold Digital. I've
                    helped manage e-commerce inventories, fully redesigned client websites, and even developed small web
                    apps to boost the productivity of my peers. However, my most formative years have been in my current
                    role as a front-end developer.</p>

                <p>The responsibilities in my current role is to maintain the front-end of some of our biggest brands
                    such as Web.com, Register.com and Network Solutions. I work in an agile environment to complete
                    tasks that range in complexity. I help make sure that these websites are accessible, performant,
                    secure, and search engine friendly.</p>

                <p>That however is only scratching the surface, you see these websites are built using Adobe Experience
                    Manager. Which means I also maintain the tools that we use to maintain the websites. Such as
                    creating components that are used for authoring pages. Writing scripts to package form data to send
                    to APIs. Even using Adobe Target to create A/B tests.</p>
